# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-
This document is a review report on the research conducted and the project
made in the field of computer engineering to develop a system for driver
drowsiness detection to prevent accidents from happening because of driver
fatigue and sleepiness.
The report proposed the results and solutions on the limited implementation of
the various techniques that are introduced in the project. Whereas the
implementation of the project give the real world idea of how the system works
and what changes can be done in order to improve the utility of the overall
system. Furthermore, the paper states the overview of the observations made by
the authors in order to help further optimization in the mentioned field to
achieve the utility at a better efficiency for a safer road.
